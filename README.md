# dot-to-dot
My personal dot-file/application/system setup automation for macOS

## Usage

Nothing fancy in these scripts. They assume they're being run from within the dot-to-dot directory and will probably break if run from a different location.

### Easy install

    ./first-run.sh

### If brew already installed on machine by other user

    ./fix-brew-permissions-on-shared-machine.sh
